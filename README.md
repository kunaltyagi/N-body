N-body
======

N body simulator, with agglomeration using bonding physics

# TODO

* mass and positions stored at different timesteps, to accomodate for delay in gravitational field as per Einstein's hypothesis
* data structure to handle mass and positions at approxx timesteps
* Fourier transform method to convert the current algo into a mixture of PPPM from current PP algorithm
* Change the algo to calculate field using multipoles and not monopoles for larger masses
